We made the website during the week period of July 21-28 2019 as part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute program in Seattle, Washington. The aim of the app is to provide daily recommendations for users whenever they're bored or unsure about what to do in their free times. Through a personalized profile that can be updated daily, users are provided optimal geolocation-based place recommendations (such as restaurants or parks) to visit, as well as indoor activities such as yoga or video games.
